<h3>BeerJS Podcast</h3>
<p>
  My good friend and mentor, David Beck and I have the good fortune to live in
  the same city as BeerJS founder, Jordan Papaleo. When we brought up the idea
  to start a podcast where we drink beer and talk JS, Jordan loved it and gave
  us his blessing. We just finished editing our pilot episode and will upload it
  shortly and share a link here.
