## Hey Friends

Here's to a blog. Shamelessly, I don't love blogs. They're like dependencies. Too many people are more concerned about making their own version of a cool thing than contributing to one that's already great but could use some help.

So that said, I don't plan on writing a lot here. But I will post when I find something worth sharing. Things like:

<li>
  - When I see a mistake I thought we all knew better than to make, its
  outcomes, and how to avoid it.
</li>
<li>
  - When I debug something and I didn't find a helpful blog post or issue near
  the top of my Google search about.
</li>

Oh yeah, and they'll be short when they can be.

-Jamie
